VIRZOOM SDK

It provides access to all the sensor data from the bike, including:
speed, pedal direction, buttons, resistance setting, and heartrate.

It also includes a high-level player controller, using our patent-pending motion controls, that combine the bike sensors with your head movement to comfortably move through large VR worlds.
